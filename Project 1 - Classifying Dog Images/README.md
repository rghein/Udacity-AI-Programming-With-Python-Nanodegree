# Project Instructions

## Principal Objectives

1. Correctly identify which pet images are of dogs (even if the breed is misclassified) and which pet images aren't of dogs.
2. Correctly classify the breed of dog, for the images that are of dogs.
3. Determine which CNN model architecture (ResNet, AlexNet, or VGG), "best" achieve objectives 1 and 2.
4. Consider the time resources required to best achieve objectives 1 and 2, and determine if an alternative solution would have given a "good enough" result, given the amount of time each of the algorithms takes to run.

## TODO:
Edit program check_images.py

The check_images.py is the program file that you will be editing to achieve the four objectives above. This file contains a main() function that outlines how to complete this program through using functions that have not yet been defined. You will be creating these undefined functions in check_images.py to achieve the objectives above.

All of the TODOs are listed in check_images.py.
