# AI Programming with Python Project 

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, students first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch.

The code for the image classifier is developed in a jupyter notebook:  Image_Classifier_Project.ipynb.

Then the code is adapted and converted it into a command line application.  That is done in the two files:  train.py and predict.py
